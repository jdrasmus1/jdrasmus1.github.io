I am a PhD candidate in clinical psychology at Duke University training as a clinician, researcher, and teacher. **My goal is to bring scientific evidence and lived experience together to improve the quality and accessibility of mental health care.**

My research focuses on how community, social, and cultural systems shape mental health risk, promotion, and intervention. I am especially focused on using clinical evidence to develop multilevel interventions that support individual mental health by strengthening families, institutions, and communities.

I grew up in Tanzania and Kenya and got my bachelorâ€™s degree in psychology from Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minnesota. After graduating, I worked with Alex Tsai at Massachusetts General Hospital for two and a half years as an on-site project coordinator for a longitudinal microenterprise, water security, health, and social network study in Mbarara, Uganda.

At the moment, I am a [von der Heyden Global Fellow](https://jhfc.duke.edu/academics/vdhfellows/) at the John Hope Franklin Center, Instructor of Record for a project-based global health and community psychology class entitled [Strengthening Families Across Contexts](https://bassconnections.duke.edu/project-teams/strengthening-families-across-contexts-multidirectional-learning-2024-2025), and a practicum trainee at the Durham VA and Duke Pediatric Neuropsychology Clinic.
