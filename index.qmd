## About Me

I am a PhD candidate in clinical psychology at Duke University and a [von der Heyden Global Fellow](https://jhfc.duke.edu/academics/vdhfellows/) at the John Hope Franklin Center. Across my training as a clinician, researcher, and teacher my goal is to bring scientific evidence and lived experience together to improve the quality and accessibility of mental health care.

I grew up in Tanzania and Kenya. I enjoy running, cooking, writing and reading poetry, and learning about almost everything (especially history).

Check out the rest of my website to learn more about my research, clinical practice, teaching and mentoring or to download my CV.
