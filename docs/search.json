I’d be happy to talk with you as well. Email me with a clear subject line and mentione how you came across my profile (so I know it’s not spam). I hope to post a resource on global mental health sometime in the future. ### Learning R Various people often ask me about how to get started using R. For that reason, I curated a very short list of Web Resources to Start Learning R. It’s not perfect, but it’ll get you going. ### Perspectives on African Mental Health & Illness Having grown up and worked in East Africa for most of my life, it’s been important to me to learn about mental health from the perspective of African people, history, and cultures. For that reason, I am working on building a database of resources on Perpectives on African Mental Health & Illness ### Make your own website"

My previous teaching experience has included conducting labs for graduate statistics and data science courses, running discussion sections for an undergraduate psychopathology course, and teaching basic psychotherapy skills to peer counselors in Kenya (pictured above).

I view academia as connected to wider communities and histories so I try to use widely available technologies (free and open source) as much as possible and engage students in critical thinking about the social, cultural, and historical context of scientific knowledge. As part of my commitment to learning and continuing to develop as a teacher, I am completing the College Teaching Certificate.\n\n\nPerspectives on African Mental Health & Illness\nIt is my experience that African voices are especially underrepresented in psychological training and teaching. Having sought out these perspectives myself, I began collecting them in a multimedia database on Perspectives on African Mental Health & Illness for students and teachers. It contains podcasts, movies, books, magazine articles, and more.\nI hope you’ll check it out, incorporate some of the resources in your teaching, or send me suggestions for additions."

(2024). “Congregation leader and member discussions in a church-based family strengthening, mental health promotion and HIV prevention trial: Intervention” Cambridge Prisms: Global Mental Health.\n\nIn this paper, I showed how inter-household conversations work as a community-level intervention process that might amplify mental and sexual health information shared during workshops held in Kenyan religious congregations. I discuss how tracking this type of process may be important to understand how interventions might create durable shifts in social context around key health issues like mental health. I also outline future directions for studying congregational settings as unique contexts for mental health and family health intervention, particularly in African countries where these are ubiquitous community institutions."
