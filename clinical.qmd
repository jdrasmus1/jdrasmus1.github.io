As a clinician, I am committed to providing evidence-based, culturally sensitive, and trauma-informed care. I have experience working with children, adolescents, and adults in a variety of outpatient settings, having delivered evidence-based therapies for mood, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, substance use, personality, and traumatic stress disorders.

### Predoctoral Internship

Starting in July 2025, I will be completing my [internship at Emory University School of Medicine](https://med.emory.edu/departments/psychiatry/education/psychology/internship/index.html) across clinics at Grady Health System, Emory Rehabilitation Hospital, and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta.
