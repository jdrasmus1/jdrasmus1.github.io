As a clinician, I am committed to providing evidence-based, culturally sensitive, and trauma-informed care. I have experience working with children, adolescents, and adults in a variety of outpatient settings, having delivered evidence-based therapies for mood, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, substance use, personality, and traumatic stress disorders.

I am currently applying to clinical internships for next year.
